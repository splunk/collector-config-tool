type: '*googlecloudpubsubexporter.Config'
doc: |
  ExporterSettings defines common settings for a component.Exporter configuration.
  Specific exporters can embed this struct and extend it with more fields if needed.

  It is highly recommended to "override" the Validate() function.

  When embedded in the exporter config, it must be with `mapstructure:",squash"` tag.
fields:
- name: timeout
  type: time.Duration
  kind: int64
  default: 12s
  doc: |
    Timeout is the timeout for every attempt to send data to the backend.
- name: sending_queue
  type: exporterhelper.QueueSettings
  kind: struct
  doc: |
    QueueSettings defines configuration for queueing batches before sending to the consumerSender.
  fields:
  - name: enabled
    kind: bool
    default: false
    doc: |
      Enabled indicates whether to not enqueue batches before sending to the consumerSender.
  - name: num_consumers
    kind: int
    doc: |
      NumConsumers is the number of consumers from the queue.
  - name: queue_size
    kind: int
    doc: |
      QueueSize is the maximum number of batches allowed in queue at a given time.
  - name: storage
    type: '*config.ComponentID'
    kind: ptr
    doc: |
      StorageID if not empty, enables the persistent storage and uses the component specified
      as a storage extension for the persistent queue
- name: retry_on_failure
  type: exporterhelper.RetrySettings
  kind: struct
  doc: |
    RetrySettings defines configuration for retrying batches in case of export failure.
    The current supported strategy is exponential backoff.
  fields:
  - name: enabled
    kind: bool
    default: false
    doc: |
      Enabled indicates whether to not retry sending batches in case of export failure.
  - name: initial_interval
    type: time.Duration
    kind: int64
    doc: |
      InitialInterval the time to wait after the first failure before retrying.
  - name: max_interval
    type: time.Duration
    kind: int64
    doc: |
      MaxInterval is the upper bound on backoff interval. Once this value is reached the delay between
      consecutive retries will always be `MaxInterval`.
  - name: max_elapsed_time
    type: time.Duration
    kind: int64
    doc: |
      MaxElapsedTime is the maximum amount of time (including retries) spent trying to send a request/batch.
      Once this value is reached, the data is discarded.
- name: project
  kind: string

    Google Cloud Project ID where the Pubsub client will connect to
- name: user_agent
  kind: string
  default: opentelemetry-collector-contrib {{version}}

    User agent that will be used by the Pubsub client to connect to the service
- name: topic
  kind: string
  default: ""
  doc: |
    The fully qualified resource name of the Pubsub topic
- name: compression
  kind: string
  default: ""

  kind: struct
  doc: |
    Watermark defines the watermark (the ce-time attribute on the message) behavior
  fields:
  - name: behavior
    kind: string
    default: current
    doc: |
      Behavior of the watermark. Currently, only  of the message (none, earliest and current, current being the default)
      will set the timestamp on pubsub based on timestamps of the events inside the message
  - name: allowed_drift
    type: time.Duration
    kind: int64
    doc: |
      Indication on how much the timestamp can drift from the current time, the timestamp will be capped to the allowed
      maximum. A duration of 0 is the same as maximum duration
