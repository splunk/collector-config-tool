  ExporterSettings defines common settings for a component.Exporter configuration.
  Specific exporters can embed this struct and extend it with more fields if needed.

  It is highly recommended to "override" the Validate() function.

  When embedded in the exporter config, it must be with `mapstructure:",squash"` tag.
fields:
- name: path
  kind: string
  default: ""
