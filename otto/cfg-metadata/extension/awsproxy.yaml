type: '*awsproxy.Config'
doc: |
  Config defines the configuration for an AWS X-Ray proxy.
fields:
- name: endpoint
  kind: string
  default: 0.0.0.0:2000
  doc: |
    Endpoint configures the address for this network connection.
    The address has the form "host:port". The host must be a literal IP address, or a host name that can be
    resolved to IP addresses. The port must be a literal port number or a service name.
    If the host is a literal IPv6 address it must be enclosed in square brackets, as in "[2001:db8::1]:80" or
    "[fe80::1%zone]:80". The zone specifies the scope of the literal IPv6 address as defined in RFC 4007.
- name: proxy_address
  kind: string
  default: ""
  doc: |
    ProxyAddress defines the proxy address that the local TCP server
    forwards HTTP requests to AWS X-Ray backend through.
- name: tls
  type: configtls.TLSClientSetting
  kind: struct
  doc: |
    TLSSetting struct exposes TLS client configuration when forwarding
    calls to the AWS X-Ray backend.
  fields:
  - name: ca_file
    kind: string
    default: ""
    doc: |
      Path to the CA cert. For a client this verifies the server certificate.
      For a server this verifies client certificates. If empty uses system root CA.
      (optional)
  - name: cert_file
    kind: string
    default: ""
    doc: |
      Path to the TLS cert to use for TLS required connections. (optional)
  - name: key_file
    kind: string
    default: ""
    doc: |
      Path to the TLS key to use for TLS required connections. (optional)
  - name: min_version
    kind: string
    default: ""
    doc: |
      MinVersion sets the minimum TLS version that is acceptable.
      If not set, TLS 1.2 will be used. (optional)
  - name: max_version
    kind: string
    default: ""
    doc: |
      MaxVersion sets the maximum TLS version that is acceptable.
      If not set, refer to crypto/tls for defaults. (optional)
  - name: reload_interval
    type: time.Duration
    kind: int64
    doc: |
      ReloadInterval specifies the duration after which the certificate will be reloaded
      If not set, it will never be reloaded (optional)
  - name: insecure
    kind: bool
    default: false
    doc: |
      In gRPC when set to true, this is used to disable the client transport security.
      See https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc#WithInsecure.
      In HTTP, this disables verifying the server's certificate chain and host name
      (InsecureSkipVerify in the tls Config). Please refer to
      https://godoc.org/crypto/tls#Config for more information.
      (optional, default false)
  - name: insecure_skip_verify
    kind: bool
    default: false
    doc: |
      InsecureSkipVerify will enable TLS but not verify the certificate.
  - name: server_name_override
    kind: string
    default: ""
    doc: |
      ServerName requested by client for virtual hosting.
      This sets the ServerName in the TLSConfig. Please refer to
      https://godoc.org/crypto/tls#Config for more information. (optional)
- name: region
  kind: string
  default: ""
  doc: |
    Region is the AWS region the local TCP server forwards requests to.
- name: role_arn
  kind: string
  default: ""
  doc: |
    RoleARN is the IAM role used by the local TCP server when
    communicating with the AWS X-Ray service.
- name: aws_endpoint
  kind: string
  default: ""
  doc: |
    AWSEndpoint is the X-Ray service endpoint which the local
    TCP server forwards requests to.
- name: local_mode
  kind: bool
  default: false
  doc: |
    LocalMode determines whether the EC2 instance metadata endpoint
    will be called or not. Set to `true` to skip EC2 instance
    metadata check.
