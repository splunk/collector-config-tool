type: '*fluentbitextension.Config'
doc: |
  Config has the configuration for the fluentbit extension.
fields:
- name: tcp_endpoint
  kind: string
  default: ""
  doc: |
    The TCP `host:port` to which the subprocess should send log entries.
    This is required unless you are overridding `args` and providing the
    output configuration yourself either in `args` or `config`.
- name: executable_path
  kind: string
  default: ""
  doc: |
    The path to the executable for FluentBit. Ideally should be an absolute
    path since the CWD of the collector is not guaranteed to be stable.
- name: args
  type: '[]string'
  kind: slice
  doc: |
    Exec arguments to the FluentBit process.  If you provide this, none of
    the standard args will be set, and only these provided args will be
    passed to FluentBit.  The standard args will set the flush interval to 1
    second, configure the forward output with the given `tcp_endpoint`
    option, enable the HTTP monitoring server in FluentBit, and set the
    config file to stdin. The only required arg is `--config=/dev/stdin`,
    since this extension passes the provided config to FluentBit via stdin.
    If you set args manually, you will be responsible for setting the
    forward output to the right port for the fluentforward receiver. See
    `process.go#constructArgs` of this extension source to see the current
    default args.
- name: config
  kind: string
  default: ""
  doc: |
    A configuration for FluentBit.  This is the text content of the config
    itself, not a path to a config file.
