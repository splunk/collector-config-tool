doc: |
  ReceiverSettings defines common settings for a component.Receiver configuration.
  Specific receivers can embed this struct and extend it with more fields if needed.

  It is highly recommended to "override" the Validate() function.

  When embedded in the receiver config it must be with `mapstructure:",squash"` tag.
