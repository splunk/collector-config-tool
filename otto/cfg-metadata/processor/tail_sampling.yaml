type: '*tailsamplingprocessor.Config'
doc: |
  Config holds the configuration for tail-based sampling.
fields:
- name: decision_wait
  type: time.Duration
  kind: int64
  default: 30s
  doc: |
    DecisionWait is the desired wait time from the arrival of the first span of
    trace until the decision about sampling it or not is evaluated.
- name: num_traces
  kind: uint64
  default: 50000
  doc: |
    NumTraces is the number of traces kept on memory. Typically most of the data
    of a trace is released after a sampling decision is taken.
- name: expected_new_traces_per_sec
  kind: uint64
  default: 0
  doc: |
    ExpectedNewTracesPerSec sets the expected number of new traces sending to the tail sampling processor
    per second. This helps with allocating data structures with closer to actual usage size.
- name: policies
  type: '[]tailsamplingprocessor.PolicyCfg'
  kind: slice
  doc: |
    PolicyCfgs sets the tail-based sampling policy which makes a sampling decision
    for a given trace when requested.

  - name: composite
    type: tailsamplingprocessor.CompositeCfg
    kind: struct
    doc: |
      Configs for defining composite policy
    fields:
    - name: max_total_spans_per_second

      kind: slice
    - name: composite_sub_policy
      type: '[]tailsamplingprocessor.CompositeSubPolicyCfg'
      kind: slice
      doc: |
        CompositeSubPolicyCfg holds the common configuration to all policies under composite policy.
      fields:
      - name: and
        type: tailsamplingprocessor.AndCfg
        kind: struct
        doc: |
          Configs for and policy evaluator.
        fields:
        - name: and_sub_policy
          type: '[]tailsamplingprocessor.AndSubPolicyCfg'
          kind: slice
          doc: |
            AndSubPolicyCfg holds the common configuration to all policies under and policy.
    - name: rate_allocation
      type: '[]tailsamplingprocessor.RateAllocationCfg'
      kind: slice
      doc: |
        RateAllocationCfg  used within composite policy
      fields:
      - name: policy
        kind: string
        default: ""
      - name: percent
        kind: int64
