  Config defines configuration for Resource processor.
fields:
- name: attributes
  type: '[]attraction.ActionKeyValue'
  kind: slice
  doc: |
    AttributesActions specifies the list of actions to be applied on resource attributes.
    The set of actions are {INSERT, UPDATE, UPSERT, DELETE, HASH, EXTRACT}.
  fields:
  - name: key
    kind: string
    default: ""
    doc: |
      Key specifies the attribute to act upon.
      This is a required field.
  - name: value
    type: interface {}
    kind: interface
    doc: |
      Value specifies the value to populate for the key.
      The type of the value is inferred from the configuration.
  - name: pattern
    kind: string
    default: ""
    doc: |
      A regex pattern  must be specified for the action EXTRACT.
      It uses the attribute specified by `key' to extract values from
      The target keys are inferred based on the names of the matcher groups
      provided and the names will be inferred based on the values of the
      matcher group.
      Note: All subexpressions must have a name.
      Note: The value type of the source key must be a string. If it isn't,
      no extraction will occur.
  - name: from_attribute
    kind: string
    default: ""
    doc: |
      FromAttribute specifies the attribute to use to populate
      the value. If the attribute doesn't exist, no action is performed.
  - name: from_context
    kind: string
    default: ""
    doc: |
      FromContext specifies the context value to use to populate
      the value. The values would be searched in client.Info.Metadata.
      If the key doesn't exist, no action is performed.
      If the key has multiple values the values will be joined with `;` separator.
  - name: converted_type
    kind: string
    default: ""
    doc: |
      ConvertedType specifies the target type of an attribute to be converted
      If the key doesn't exist, no action is performed.
      If the value cannot be converted, the original value will be left as-is
  - name: action
    type: attraction.Action
    kind: string
    default: ""
    doc: |
      Action specifies the type of action to perform.
      The set of values are {INSERT, UPDATE, UPSERT, DELETE, HASH}.
      Both lower case and upper case are supported.
      INSERT -  Inserts the key/value to attributes when the key does not exist.
                No action is applied to attributes where the key already exists.
                Either Value, FromAttribute or FromContext must be set.
      UPDATE -  Updates an existing key with a value. No action is applied
                to attributes where the key does not exist.
                Either Value, FromAttribute or FromContext must be set.
      UPSERT -  Performs insert or update action depending on the attributes
                containing the key. The key/value is inserted to attributes
                that did not originally have the key. The key/value is updated
                for attributes where the key already existed.
                Either Value, FromAttribute or FromContext must be set.
      DELETE  - Deletes the attribute. If the key doesn't exist,
                no action is performed.
      HASH    - Calculates the SHA-1 hash of an existing value and overwrites the
                value with it's SHA-1 hash result.
      EXTRACT - Extracts values using a regular expression rule from the input
                'key' to target keys specified in the 'rule'. If a target key
                already exists, it will be overridden.
      CONVERT  - converts the type of an existing attribute, if convertable
      This is a required field.
