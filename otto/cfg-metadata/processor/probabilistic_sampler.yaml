  Config has the configuration guiding the trace sampler processor.
fields:
- name: sampling_percentage
  kind: float32
  doc: |
    SamplingPercentage is the percentage rate at which traces are going to be sampled. Defaults to zero, i.e.: no sample.
    Values greater or equal 100 are treated as "sample all traces".
- name: hash_seed
  kind: uint32
  default: 0
  doc: |
    HashSeed allows one to configure the hashing seed. This is important in scenarios where multiple layers of collectors
    have different sampling rates: if they use the same seed all passing one layer may pass the other even if they have
    different sampling rates, configuring different seeds avoids that.
